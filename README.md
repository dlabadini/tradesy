Textbook trading platform with ability to identify trading opportunities in addition to buying and selling

I would like to see the concept opened up to more products. Currently, includes PayPal integration, messaging, and auto-notifications. Platform needs integrated shipping, option to rent, Google / Facebook login support, stronger / cleaner messaging, community driven data for classes and books OR college and textbook provider data integrations. In addition, platform could be successful on mobile.
