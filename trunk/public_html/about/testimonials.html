"I used CollegeBookEvolution.com and saved about $50 on just one book :) I hope more people sign up. I am impressed with the setup. It definately helps to be able to see exactly what's going on."

Students,<br/><br/>
Amanda was in my BCOR 370 (Managing Individuals and Teams) class and very skeptical about the web site. I listened to her feedback and concerns and developed a free trial account so students could not only experience the benefits but gain some faith in the service. I dare you to try it! <a href='http://www.collegebookevolution.com/register.php' target='_blank'> Join the eVOLUTION now!</a>
