The College Book Evolution Team would like to bring to your attention an exciting new online service, starting at West Virginia University. <a href='http://www.collegebookevolution.com' target='_blank'>CollegeBookEvolution.com</a> is a revolutionary way to buy and sell textbooks. The website brings buyers and seller together, in order to buy, sell, and trade. Buyers are able to contact sellers, set up a meeting on campus to make the textbook sale or trade. CollegeBookEvolution.com can practically eliminate textbook costs; that means approximately <b>$700 per semester.</b><a href='http://www.collegebookevolution.com/learnmore/?ref=numbers' target='_blank'> Compared</a> to using college bookstores or similar services, collegebookevolution.com can<b> save you up to $400 per semester.</b>
<br/><br/>
How can this be???

<ul>
  <li>Introduces buyers to sellers, which means;</li>
  <li>No middleman, student-to-student sale or trade;</li>
  <li>Buyers spend less and sellers get more; </li>
  <li>Enables students to use the books they have to get the textbooks they need</li>
</ul>

How does this work???

 <ul>
  <li>Sign Up</li>
  <li>Student lists their upcoming classes</li>
  <li>Student purchases textbook credits ($1-$1.50 each) and lists the textbooks they own and would like to sell</li>
  <li>When a student finds a book or match they desire, CollegeBookEvolution.com will email the seller, notifying them that a member is interested in their book. Seller can choose to reply to the interested member. Seller's personal information is never provided.</li>
  <li>Set up meeting in public location to sell, buy, or trade.</li>
</ul>
We <b>urge you as a parent</b> to have your student to use this service before they resort to College Bookstores. One parent said, "I would definitely pay for this service and make my kid go on the web site to find textbooks before going to college bookstores, the savings potential is incredible."
<br/><br/>
The site features a  <a href='http://www.collegebookevolution.com/help/?ref=faqs#bartertrade' target='_blank'>"barter trade"</a> option which matches your student with other students who both have the book they want and are looking for the book they currently own. 
<br/><br/>
Student Government Association Governor, <a href='http://sga.studentorgs.wvu.edu/board_of_governors/taylor_richmond' target='_blank'>Taylor Richmond</a>, has lifted up the College Book Evolution by saying, "This is exactly what the student body needs, a tool that empowers the students. I encourage every student to participate in the evolution. The website is uniquely designed; making it student-to-student is genius. The benefits and savings of using the website allows students to realize that the membership price will quickly pay for itself within the first book or two."
