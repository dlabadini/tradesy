  <li>The above example shows a possible senario, demonstrating savings in comparsion to college bookstores. </li><br/>
  <li>These are actual numbers, however, the buy back price used above is 50% of the new price, to show the best case senario for using a college bookstore. Often times, students will not receive the full "Buy Back" price from college bookstores. Therefore in the above example, the cost for college bookstores would actually range from $731.01-$901.52</li><br/>
  <li>Sometimes, the book for a class may change, this is only a road bump, and it is somewhat irrelevant because often times college bookstores will not buy back these textbook anyways. </li><br/>
  <li>The provided example above is an anticipated scenario, results will vary.
  Bottom line, textbook costs can be eliminated or reduced dramatically.</li><br/>
