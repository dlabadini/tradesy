As one can see, your books can be virtually free; simply by using the optimal pricing, and using the textbooks you have to obtain the books you need. If you were to use another textbook source this would not be possible, evolving is the only way.
<br/><br/>
Key conclusions and thoughts:
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>The membership fee is nominal and will pay for its self. Just look at the savings, and the costs that are eliminated!</li>
  <li>The possible savings from this service are colossal; this is essentially a yearly stimulus check for you or your parents.</li>
  <li>Also, there is the possibility of having a surplus (making money), if the books you need cost less than the books you already own. </li>
  <li> When a student graduates, he/she will be leaving with more money in their pocket compared to selling it back to a college bookstore, and feel proud about helping this savings system to continue. </li>
  <li>Enables students to use the books they have to get the textbooks they need</li>
<br/>
<ul/>
