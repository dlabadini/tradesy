<ol><b>This is true evolution, College Book Evolution.</b></ol>
Here, at Learn More, your eyes will be open to how we, the students, 
 are being exploited. You will discover how to sell and trade the books
 you are done with and use the proceeds to buy the books you now need,
 not in the regular fashion, but using an evolutionary process.  Also,
 you will learn how the web site can practically eliminate college 
 textbook costs, and your role in the college book evolution.
