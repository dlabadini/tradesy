<ol><b>This is true evolution, College Book Evolution.</b></ol>
It is evident you are interested in filling your pockets with more cash and spending less on textbooks. In summary it mean you value the better things in life, because if you have cash you can relax; going out, video games, flowers for the girlfriend, you name it. <br/><br/>So you are wondering, how does the thing, CollegeBookEvolution.com, actually work. It's quite easy, we do most of the work for you. <br/><br/>
"Student A" is taking Accounting 201 next semester and you are about to pass the class with flying colors in a few weeks. You being the genius you are use CollegeBookEvolution.com and have listed all the textbooks you own for sale. After "Student A" does research and discovers the bookstore sells the textbook for $200 new and $150 used, "Student A" joins the revolution and searches on CollegeBookEvolution.com. "Student A" comes across you textbook for sale ($120) and simply contacts you for it. Once you receive "Student A's" message the two of you communicate and figure out the details.  
<br/><br/>
Here's what is neat, the bookstore might have given $95 if you sold the textbook back to them, but instead you received $120. And, "Student A" saved either $80 or $30. WIN-WIN BABY!!

Not to brag but you should probably read up on our auto-notification and barter trade option - they are sorta impressive.
