College Bookstores continue to take advantage of you, by buying back your books at a fraction of what you paid, then reselling your books, at the used price, which is marked up a substantial amount.<br/><br/>
<b>DO NOT SELL YOUR BOOKS BACK TO COLLEGE BOOKSTORES!!</b>
<br/><br/>
COLLEGEBOOKEVOLUTION.COM is a revolutionary way to buy and sell textbooks. The website brings buyers and seller together. Buyers are able to contact sellers, set up a meeting on campus to make the textbook sale or trade.
<br/><br/>
CollegeBookEvolution.com can practically eliminate textbook costs, that means approximately <b>$700 per semester!</b><a href='http://www.collegebookevolution.com/learnmore/?ref=numbers' target='_blank'> Compared</a> to using college bookstores or similar services, CollegeBookEvolution.com can <b>save you up to $400 per semester.</b>
<br/><br/>
How can this be???

<ul>
  <li>Introduces buyers to sellers, which means;</li>
  <li>No middleman, student-to-student sale or trade;</li>
  <li>Buyers spend less and sellers get more; </li>
  <li>Enables students to use the books they have to get the textbooks they need</li>
</ul>

How does this work???

 <ul>
  <li>Students pay low membership fee which enables them to buy and sell</li>
  <li>Buyers list classes, sellers list books</li>
  <li>When a student finds a book or match they desire, CollegeBookEvolution.com will email the seller, notifying them that a member is interested in their book. Seller can choose to reply to the interested member. Seller's personal information is never provided.</li>
  <li>Set up meeting in public location to sell, buy, or trade.</li>
</ul>

So what does this all mean again???

<ul>
  <li>Textbooks are being negotiated through the CollegeBookEvolution.com; by using our enhanced pricing system, spending money on textbooks is a thing of the past. Once students are connected with each other, they are able to contact the seller, and set up a meeting on campus to make the transaction.
</li>

Student Government Association Governor, Taylor Richmond, has lifted up the College Book Evolution by saying, "This is exactly what the student body needs, a tool that empowers the students. I encourage every student to participate in the evolution. The website is uniquely designed; making it student-to-student is genius. The benefits and savings of using the website allows students to realize that the membership price will quickly pay for itself within the first book or two."
