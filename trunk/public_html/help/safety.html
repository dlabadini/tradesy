<h3>The Meeting:</h3>
<p>
A first meeting with any new person can be awkward, and most first meetings are perfectly safe. But it's always smart to take basic precautions. Always trust your instincts. Be sure when meeting to make a transaction (trade, purchase, sale) on campus follow these guidelines:

<ol>
    <li><b>DO</b> meet in public.
        <ul>
            <li>ALWAYS arrange to meet in a populated, well lit, public place. NEVER meet in a private or remote location.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>DO</b> tell a friend.
        <ul>
            <li>Tell at least one friend or family member you are meeting, where you are going and when you expect to return, or <i>have a friend come with you.</i>
               <ul>
                  <li>Tip: Contact your friend before and after or ask your friend to contact you at a predetermined time.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <li><b>DON'T</b> leave home without your mobile phone.  </li>
</ol>
