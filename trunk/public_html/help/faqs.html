    <li><b>What is CollegeBookEvolution.com? </b>
    <ul>
        <li>A web site that empowers college students. CollegeBookEvolution.com is designed to connect college students with each other in order to essentially "trade" all of their textbooks. CollegeBookEvolution.com is not necessarily about buying or selling, it is about facilitating the transfer of assets in a way that significantly reduces the cost of textbook and gives more money to sellers compared to the alternative, on campus bookstores. <a href='http://www.collegebookevolution.com/learnmore'>Learn More</a>.
        </li>
        <li>CollegeBookEvolution.com does not yet assist in the transfer of funds. As of now the service is designed for students to make the exchange in person on campus. Students are not required to meet on campus, if the two students decide to utilize shipping they should evaluate any potential problems that could arise. There are numerous pros and cons for a person to person exchange; we have chosen this method because we feel the pros outweigh the cons.

    <li id='optimalprice'><b>What is Optimal Price? </b>
        <ul>
            <li>The "optimal price" creates a win-win for both buyers and sellers. This is the price that enables an even transfer of assets. The "optimal price" gives students who are selling their textbook more money compared to their alternative, selling their textbook back to a bookstore. Also, the "optimal price" saves students who are buying money, compared to their alternative, buying from a college bookstore at a new or used price.  <a href='http://www.collegebookevolution.com/learnmore'>Learn More</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li><b>What is New Price? </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Price of the book from a college bookstore if it is new (sealed, never used).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>What is Buy Back Price?  </b>
        <ul>
            <li>The "buy back price" is the approximate amount that a bookstore will give a student for selling back the book to them, often times college book stores will give even less than this amount.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>What is Used Price? </b>
        <ul>
            <li>The "used price" is the approximate price a college bookstore will sell the book for if used. (Note: The used books they are selling are from students that have sold back their textbooks to them.)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Why are there price limits when listing a textbook?      </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Price limits are in place for several reasons. The main reason is to keep prices close to the "optimal price," in order to emliminate or dramitcally reduce textbook costs. Another reason is so a greedy student with the same mentality as the college bookstores is not able to take advantage of a web site that is designed to eliminate textbook costs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li><b>What does "practically free" or "eliminate textbook costs" mean?      </b>
        <ul>
            <li>"Practically free" or "eliminate textbook costs" refers to the possibility that your textbooks could be free. If costs are not eliminated then one can expect them to be dramatically reduced. This depends on a number of circumstances based on your individual effort, participation, availability, and ability to comprehend, follow, and apply the system. "The system" is the way the web site is set up to enable efficient transfer of assets (textbooks).
