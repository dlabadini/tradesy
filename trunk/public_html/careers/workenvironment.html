No matter if you are a "Campus Director", "Marketing Team", or "Intern",
your work environment is pretty much up to you. You manage and control your
schedule, ideas, plans, and campaign. As a Marketing Team, members of
the team have the ability to make marketing as fun and creative as
they desire.
